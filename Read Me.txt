🚀 Running the Project

The project consists of multiple steps, each handled by a separate script. Execute them in the following order:

1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning

python scripts/data_preprocessing.py

✔ Reads raw data, handles missing values, removes duplicates, and prepares the dataset.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

python scripts/exploratory_analysis.py

✔ Generates summary statistics, identifies data trends, and visualizes key metrics.

3️⃣ Popular Item Analysis

python scripts/popular_items.py

✔ Identifies best-selling products globally, country-wise, and month-wise.

4️⃣ Customer Segmentation

python scripts/customer_segmentation.py

✔ Performs RFM analysis and clustering to segment customers based on buying patterns.

5️⃣ Sales Trend Analysis

python scripts/sales_trend.py

✔ Analyzes seasonal sales trends and yearly growth insights.

6️⃣ Data Visualization & Reporting

python scripts/data_visualization.py

✔ Creates interactive visualizations using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Power BI/Tableau.
